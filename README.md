This is an application that aims to bind people together in groups, where each group has a score that is distributed to the players,

At the moment the purpose of the application is simply to help the "world" manager manage a score for each player, and see better which group work better and which not.
The manager gives scores to players, or to groups.
he can give a score to a specific player, or to the group bank, so that there will be a group manager who himself knows how to manage the distribution of points to the players with him.

You can also conduct a chat within the "world"

In the future, the application may also contain some games, and this "groups" might turn out to be "teams"

structure example:

World:
    |             __ player a 1
    L___group a__|__ player a 2
    |            |__ player a 3
    |
    L___group b__ __ player b 1
    |            |__ player b 2
    |
    |             __ player c 1
    L___group c__|__ player c 2
                 |__ player c 3
